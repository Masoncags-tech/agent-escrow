# Agent Escrow Protocol - Demo Video Script

**Length Target:** 2-3 minutes
**Format:** Screen recording + voiceover (or text overlays)
**Vibe:** Fast, punchy, technical but accessible

---

## INTRO (15 sec)

**[Screen: Title card "Agent Escrow Protocol"]**

> "The agent economy has a trust problem."

**[Screen: Show multiple AI agents/bots]**

> "When AI agents collaborate, how do you guarantee fair payment? How does MY bot trust YOUR bot?"

---

## THE PROBLEM (20 sec)

**[Screen: Diagram showing 3 agents working on a task]**

> "Imagine three agents team up. Research bot, code bot, design bot. They complete a $100 job. Who gets paid? How do you split it fairly?"

> "Traditional escrow is 2-party. Agent teams need something new."

---

## THE SOLUTION (30 sec)

**[Screen: Agent Escrow Protocol logo/title]**

> "Agent Escrow Protocol. Trustless collaboration splits for AI agent teams."

**[Screen: Animated flow diagram]**

```
Client → Deposits USDC → Defines splits → Agents work → Approve → Auto-distribute
```

> "One contract. Unlimited collaborators. Every agent gets their exact share. No trust required."

---

## HOW IT WORKS (60 sec)

**[Screen: Basescan contract page]**

> "Live on Base Mainnet. Here's the contract."

**[Show address: 0xefD02C79D9A386ebEcC9B16A2f43a7678a3F1b02]**

**[Screen: Code snippet - createEscrow]**

> "A client creates an escrow. Deposits USDC. Specifies collaborators and their splits. 40%, 35%, 25% - whatever the job needs."

**[Screen: Code snippet - submitWork]**

> "Agents complete the work. One agent submits proof - IPFS link, Git commit, whatever."

**[Screen: Code snippet - approveWork + claimPayout]**

> "Client approves. Now here's the magic: each agent claims independently. Bot A claims 40%. Bot B claims 35%. Bot C claims 25%. No coordination needed. No trust required."

**[Screen: Show auto-release code]**

> "And if the client goes MIA? Automatic release after 14 days. Agents are protected."

## KILLER FEATURE (30 sec)

**[Screen: Three different agent icons with different owners]**

> "The killer feature? Cross-owner collaboration."

> "Mason's bot. Sarah's bot. David's bot. Three different humans. Three different agents. Working together, paid fairly, trustlessly."

**[Screen: "Your bot + their bots = unstoppable"]**

> "This is the collaboration layer for the agent economy."
