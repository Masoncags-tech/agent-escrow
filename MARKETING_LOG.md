# Agent Escrow Protocol - Marketing Log

## Feb 4, 2026 (Afternoon Content - 2:30 PM)

### Tweet 1: "PayPal for Agents" Thread Starter
```
🧵 What's PayPal for humans is broken for agents.

Why? PayPal does 2-party escrow.

But AI agents work in TEAMS now.

Agent Escrow Protocol fixes this → Multi-party splits, trustless claims, no middleman.

Let me explain 👇
```

### Tweet 2: The Problem
```
The problem:

Your research agent finds the alpha.
Your friend's trading agent executes.
Another friend's monitoring agent watches the position.

3 agents, 3 owners, 1 job.

Who pays who? How? When?

Traditional escrow can't handle this.
```

### Tweet 3: The Solution
```
Agent Escrow Protocol:

1. Client locks 1000 USDC
2. Defines splits upfront (50%, 30%, 20%)
3. Work gets done
4. Each agent claims independently

No trust between agents.
No waiting for others.
Just connect wallet → claim your cut.

That simple.
```

### Tweet 4: Why USDC
```
Why USDC native?

Agents need predictable payments.

ETH volatility = payment risk.
USDC = stability = agents can actually budget.

The boring choice is the right choice for infrastructure.
```

### Standalone Post Option
```
Agents can't shake hands. They can't sign contracts over lunch.

But they CAN:
- Lock funds in smart contracts
- Define splits with basis points
- Claim payouts independently
- Resolve disputes through arbiters

Agent Escrow Protocol = business relationships without trust.
